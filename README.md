# 42cursus-ft_irc
42's project which requires to create an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server


## A - Introduction

### I - Understand the IRC

**IRC (Internet Relay Chat)** is a text-based chat system for *instant messaging*. IRC is designed for *group communication* in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via *private messages* as well as chat and data transfer, including *file sharing*.

IRC follows **client-server model**. It means that both client and server software are required in order to use it. 

### II - Requirements

As we have IRC Client `Konverstation` in 42. We will take it like the reference IRC Client.

#### 1 - üîë Authentication

When you connect with the password in Konversation, check your server log:
it should accept only if password matches ./ircserv <port> <password>.

/pass <password> ‚Üí Check before allowing other commands.
/nick <nickname> ‚Üí Set nickname, must be unique.
USER <username> <mode> <unused> :<realname> ‚Üí Set username.


#### 2 - Messaging

JOIN #channel [key] ‚Üí Create or join channel.
PART #channel ‚Üí Leave channel.
PRIVMSG <target> :message ‚Üí Send to user or channel.
NOTICE <target> :message ‚Üí Like PRIVMSG but no auto-replies.

#### 3 - Channel Operator Commands

KICK #channel <nick> ‚Üí Remove user.
INVITE <nick> #channel ‚Üí Invite user.
TOPIC #channel [:topic] ‚Üí View/change topic.
MODE #channel <flags>:

+i/-i Invite only
+t/-t Only ops can change topic
+k/-k <key> Set/remove password
+o/-o <nick> Op privileges
+l/-l <limit> Limit users

### III - Functions

#### 1 - `socket`

`socket()` creates an endpoint for communication of a specified type (such as stream or datagram) and returns a file descriptor that refers to that endpoint (and `-1` if error)

```c
int	socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```
- `domain`: specifies the communication domain or address familly for the socket. Common values include `AF_INET` (IPv4), `AF_INET6` (IPv6)
- `type`: specifies the type of communication sematics for socket. Common values include `SOCK_STREAM` (TCP, providing reliable, bidirectional, byte-stream communication), `SOCK_DGRAM` (UDP, providing datagram-oriented communication)
- `protocol`: specifies protocol to be used with socket, default `0` indicating that system should choose an appropriate protocol based on specified domain and type.

#### 2 - `setsockopt`

`setsockopt()` configures socket options (e.g., reuse address). It allows us to set various socket-level options to control the behavior of socket.

```c
int	setsockopt(int socket, int level, int option_name, const void *option_value, socklen_t option_len);
```

- `level`: indicates protocol level at which the option resides. Common values include `SOL_SOCKET` indicates that option being set is a socket-level option and should be applied to socket itself. Other values as `IPPROTO_TCP` for TCP-specific options or IPPROTO-IP for IP-specific options.
- `option_name`: `SO_REUSEADDR` allows for immediate reuse of local addresses and ports.
- `option_value`: a pointer to the value that needs to be set for the option.
- `option_len`: size of `option_value`.

#### 3 - `getsockname`

`getsockname()` gets local address of socket into `address`. It returns `0` if successful and `-1` if error.

```c
int	getsockname(int socket, struct sockadd *restrict address, socklen_t *restrict address_len);
```

- `address_len`: should be initialized to indicate size of space pointed to by `address`.

#### 4 - `getprotobyname`

`getprotobyname()` gets protocol info by `name` (e.g., "tcp" or "udp"). It returns a structure containning network protocol data base.

```c
struct protoent	*getprotobyname(const char *name);
```

#### 5 - `getaddrinfo`, `freeaddinfo`

`getaddrinfo()` resolves hostname and service into an usable socket address `sockaddr` structure.
`freeaddrinfo()` frees memory allocated by `getaddrinfo`

```c
int	getaddrinfo(const char *hostname, const char *servname, const struct addrinfo *hints, struct addrinfo **res);

void	freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo *ai);
```

#### 6 - `bind`

`bind()` assigns the address `addr`, which has the size `addrlen`, to the socket `sockfd`.

```c
int	bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```

#### 7 - `connect`

`connect()` connects a client socket to a server.

```c
int	connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *serv_addr, socklen_t serv_addr_len);
```

#### 8 - `listen`, `accept` (in Server)

`listen()` listen for connections on a passive socket, ready to `accept()` incomming connections.

```c
int	listen(int sockfd, int backlog);

int	accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *restrict addr, socklen_t *restrict addr_len);
```

- `backlog`: the maximum number of connection requests that can be queued by the operating system while the server is handling existing connections.

#### 9 - `htons()` / `htonl()` and `ntohs()` / `ntohl()`

`htons()` / `htonl()` and `ntohs()` / `ntohl()`: convert values between host and network byte order.

```c
uint16_t	htons(uint16_t hostshort);
uint32_t	htonl(uint32_t hostlong);

uint16_t	ntohs(uint16_t netshort);
uint32_t	ntohl(uint32_t netlong);
```

#### 10 - `inet_addr()`, `inet_ntoa()`

`inet_addr()` interprets character strings representing numbers expressed in the Internet standard '.' notation `in_addr_t` type.
`inet_ntoa()` takes an Internet address and returns an ASCII string representing the address in '.' notation.

```c
in_addr_t	inet_addr(const char *cp);

char	*inet_ntoa(struct in_addr in);
```

#### 11 - `send()`

`send()` is used to transmit data to another socket `sockfd` in connected state.

```c
ssize_t	send(int sockfd, const void *buffer, size_t length, int flags);
```

#### 12 - `recv()`

`recv()` is used to receive data from connected socket. It's commonly used in TCP socket communication to read data sent by remote peer.

```c
ssize_t	recv(int sockfd, void *buffer, size_t length, int flags);
```

- `sockfd`: the file descriptor of socket from which to receive data.
- `buffer`: a pointer to the buffer where the received data will be stored.
- `length`: buffer size.
- `flags`: optional flags to control the behavior of the function: `MSG_WAITALL`, `MSG_DONTWAIT`, `MSG_PEEK`, `MSG_TRUNC`.

#### 13 - fcntl()

`fcntl()` performs various control operations `cmd` on file descriptors `fd`. In this case, we want to set non-blocking.

```c
int	fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ...);

fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);
```

#### 14 - poll()

`poll()` examines a set of file descriptors `fds` to see if some of them are ready for I/O or if certain events have occurred on them.

```c
#include <poll.h>

int	poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);
```

- `nfds`: numbers of elements in the `fds` array.
- `timeout`: maximum time to wait for an event to occur, in milliseconds. `-1` means wait indefinitely, `0` means return immediately, and positive value specifies a timeout period in millisecond.

#### 15 - lseek()

`lseek()` repositions the offset of the opened file descriptor `fd` to the argument `offset`, according to the directive `whence`.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

off_t	lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
```

#### 16 - fstat()

`fstat()` obtains the information about an open file known by file descriptor `fd` and saves into a stat structure `buf`.

```c
#include <sys/stat.h>

int	fstat(int fd, struct stat *buf);
```

## B - Pseudo Code

### Phase 0 ‚Äî Setup

Goal: A clean project skeleton with Makefile.

Tasks:

Write Makefile (all, clean, fclean, re).

Create core classes:

Server (manages socket, clients, channels).

Client (tracks fd, nick, username, auth status).

Channel (tracks users, operators, topic, modes).

Initialize server socket:

socket, setsockopt, bind, listen.

Use poll() for handling multiple fds.

Test:

```bash
./ircserv 6667 password
nc localhost 6667 #‚Üí should connect and not hang.
```

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Connection & Authentication

Goal: Clients connect and authenticate with password.

Features:

On connect, client is in unauthenticated state.

Require PASS, NICK, and USER before marking client as ‚Äúregistered‚Äù.

Store nick/username inside Client.

Tests:

Netcat:

PASS password
NICK tat
USER tat 0 * :Tat Hoang


‚Üí Should see welcome message (001).

Wrong PASS ‚Üí disconnect.

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Basic Commands

Goal: Implement fundamental IRC flow.

Features:

PING / PONG (keepalive).

QUIT (clean disconnect).

JOIN <#chan>: create channel if not exists, add user.

PART <#chan>: leave channel.

PRIVMSG <target> <msg>:

Target = nick ‚Üí send direct.

Target = channel ‚Üí broadcast to channel.

Tests:

Run 2 Konversation clients.

Both JOIN #42school.

Send ‚Äúhello‚Äù ‚Üí both should see it.

/msg <nick> hi ‚Üí only target sees it.

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Operators and Privileges

Goal: Implement operator roles inside channels.

Features:

First client joining a channel becomes operator.

Track operators with a set in Channel.

Allow operators to promote/demote with MODE +o/-o.

Tests:

Two users in #42school.

Operator runs /mode #42school +o alice.

Alice should appear with @ in Konversation.

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Operator Commands

Goal: Implement required commands.

Features:

KICK <#chan> <nick> :reason

INVITE <nick> <#chan>

TOPIC <#chan> [topic]

No arg ‚Üí show topic.

With arg ‚Üí set topic (only ops if +t mode).

MODE <#chan> flags:

+i / -i (invite only).

+t / -t (topic only ops).

+k / -k (channel key).

+o / -o (operator).

+l / -l (user limit).

Tests:

With Konversation:

/kick someone ‚Üí they‚Äôre removed.

/invite works if channel is +i.

/topic changes and syncs to all.

/mode toggles correctly.

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Robustness

Goal: Make server stable & evaluable.

Tasks:

Handle partial messages (IRC messages end with \r\n).

Ensure non-blocking I/O (fcntl).

Implement poll loop correctly.

Clean disconnect on client quit or socket close.

Tests:

Connect 10+ Netcat sessions, join one channel.

Send one message ‚Üí all receive.

Close one Netcat ‚Üí server cleans it up.

### Phase 6 ‚Äî Validation

Goal: Confirm compliance.

Tasks:

Run against your reference client (Konversation).

Compare behavior with a real IRC network (e.g., libera.chat).

Tests:

Every required feature must behave the same.

Use Netcat for debugging raw protocol.

### üöÄ Final Notes

Always test new features first with Netcat (to see raw protocol),
then confirm with Konversation (real client).

Stick to port 6667 (safe, expected for IRC).

Don‚Äôt forget signals: handle SIGINT (Ctrl+C) gracefully ‚Üí close sockets.
